# VIX Calculation

**An introduction on VIX**
VIX index is the market expectation of future realized volatility under risk neutral measure (Or more appropriately it is the quadratic variation instead of realized volatility). We will be able to construct the VIX index as a replicating portfolio of variance futures so that vix index and option premium (replicating cost) can be linked. Thus a model free estimation of vix is here.
