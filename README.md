# Vix
For Vix calculation (volatility index)

## Intro

**An introduction on VIX**

VIX index is the market expectation of future realized volatility under risk neutral measure (Or more appropriately it is the quadratic variation instead of realized volatility). We will be able to construct the VIX index as a replicating portfolio of variance futures so that vix index and option premium (replicating cost) can be linked. Thus a model free estimation of vix is here. 


**Information Content of VIX**

Conventially, VIX index is taken as a good estimator of realized volatility for a future period. Jiang & Tian (2005) argued that the model free VIX index contains historical realized volatility. In a regression analysis of future realized volatility ~ VIX index + historical realized volatility, VIX index is siginificant while the coefficient is not 1 (They argued that this is a demonstration that VIX is a biased estimator on future realized volatility - usually higher than 1 a phenomenon related to variance risk premium). They concluded that the model free vix contains the information of historical realized volatility and is an more efficient estimator on future realized volatility.

As Jiang & Tian (2005) demonstrated, VIX is usually larger than future realized volatility. This phenomenon is in some degree related to variance risk premium (VRP - the strike price of US variance swap is usually larger than realized variance). Carr & Wu (2008) believes that the difference between VIX and future realized variance can be used as an estimator of VRP. They argued that "investors are willing to pay extra money to enter into variance because they dislike variance, not just because it is anti-correlated with stock prices, but on its own right. This lead to many considerating variance as an asset clas in and of itself"


## Intuition of VIX index


Assume market price of the underlying follows the Geometric Brownian Motion without jump as below.

$$\frac{dS_t}{S_t} = \mu(t,...)dt + \sigma(t,...)dZ_t$$


**Variance Forward**

For a variance forward with delievery price of k, its price should be $F = E^Q[e^{-rT}(V - K)]$ as per no arbitrage pricing where V is the realized variance $V = \frac{1}{T}\int_o^T\sigma^2(t,...)dt$.

For such a forward, the fair delivery price (the delievery price k that set F to 0) should be as follows 

$$
\begin{aligned}
K_{var} &= E^Q[V] \\
&=\frac{1}{T}E^Q[\int_o^T\sigma^2(t,...)dt]
\end{aligned}
$$

**Replicating variance forward**
Since the instantaneous variance is unknown, we hope to construct a replicating portfolio to estimate $K_{var}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
K_{var} &= \frac{1}{T}E^Q[\int_o^T\sigma^2(t,...)dt] \\
&= \frac{2}{T} E^Q[\int_0^T \frac{dS_t}{S_t} - d(logS_t)] \\ 
& =  \frac{2}{T} E^Q[\int_0^T\frac{dS_t}{S_t} - log(\frac{S_T}{S_0})]
\end{aligned}
$$

It is clear that, exposue to variance can be obtained via 2 positions:

1. a dynamic position on $\frac{1}{S_t}$ share of the underlying
2. a static position on log contract

Based on the assumption, we can get the expectation of part 1 as $E^Q[\int_0^T \frac{dS_t}{S_t}] = rT$

As to part 2 (the static log contract), we can obtain the log contract via the portfolio of forward and options. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{S_T}{S_0} &= log\frac{S_T}{S_{\star}} + log\frac{S_{\star}}{S_0} \\ 
log\frac{S_T}{S_{\star}} & = \frac{S_T - S_{\star}}{S_{\star}} \\
&+\int_0^{S_\star} \frac{1}{k^2} Max(K-S_T, 0)dK \\
&+\int_{S_\star}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2} Max(S_T - K, 0)dK
\end{aligned}
$$

Take the expectation of the 2 position we got so far. We can get the VIX as below. It should be noted that $S_{\star}$ is an arbitrary number. Since OTM options usually come with better liquidity, COBE choose to use the OTM call and put for the calculation VIX. In this situation, $S_{\star}$ is the spot price (or other price that can be used to determine what is OTM).

$$
\begin{aligned}
K_{var} &= \frac{2}{T}[rT - (\frac{S_0}{S_{\star}}e^{rT} - 1) - log\frac{S_{\star}}{S_0} \\ 
& + e^{rT}\int_0^{S_{\star}} \frac{1}{K^2}P(K)dK \\
& + e^{rT}\int_{S_{\star}}^{\infty} \frac{1}{K^2}C(K)dK ]
\end{aligned}
$$

For the calibration in real world, various numerical method can be used.

**CBOE Numerical Method**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sigma^2 &= \frac{2}{T}\sum\frac{\Delta K_i}{K_i^2}e^{rT}Q(K_i) - \frac{1}{T}[\frac{F}{K_0} - 1]^2 \\
\Delta K_i &= \frac{K_{i+1} - K_{i-1}}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

- The first part is about the expectation of an option, in natural it is a integration
- The second part is the 1st order Taylor expansion of the log contract

**Demeterfi et al (1999) formula**

DDKZ further deduced to the following form. The full proof is available in the appendix of Jiang & Tian (2007)

$$
K_{var} = \frac{2 e^{rT}}{T}[e^{rT}\int_0^{F_0} \frac{1}{K^2}P(K)dK 
+ e^{rT}\int_{F_0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{K^2}C(K)dK]
$$

**The $\frac{1}{K^2}$ option portfolio under BSM**

$$
\begin{aligned}
vega &= \frac{\partial C}{\partial \sigma^2} = \frac{S\sqrt{\tau}}{2\sigma}\frac{exp(-d_1^2/2)}{\sqrt{2}\pi}\\
\Pi &= \int_{0}^{\infty} w(k) O(S, K, v) dK \\
vega_{\pi} &= \int_{0}^{\infty} w(k) vega_o(S,K,v) dK \\
\end{aligned}
$$

To make the portfolio vega invariant to underlying price, set the partial derivative to 0

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial vega_{\Pi}}{\partial S} &= 0 \\
\downarrow \\
2w(k) + K\frac{\partial w(k)}{\partial K} &= 0 \\
\downarrow \\ 
w(k) &= \frac{const}{K^2}
\end{aligned}
$$


**Legacy CBOE VIX calculation**

The initial version of the CBOE VIX index is based on Whaley(1993, 2000). The method at the time is based on S&P 100 indx options. It take the equal weighted average of the Implied volatility of ATM option as the VIX Index. 

There are 2 major drawbacks on this method. Firstly, it relies on BSM model to get implied volatility hence it is susceptibel to BSM errors. Secondly it might ignore information from OTM and ITM options.

Since 2003, COBE improved their method based on DDKZ (1999) reserach report and change the underlying to S&P 500. It is the current version of method that CBOE used for VIX index calculation.
